## 2024-05-14 - Replace input buttons with `<button>` tags for Async operations
**Learning:** Using `<input type="submit">` for important asynchronous actions (like payment processing) prevents the inclusion of visual feedback elements like inline spinners (`CircularProgress`). This leads to a poor user experience as the user is unsure if their action registered, and can cause anxiety during sensitive operations like payments.
**Action:** When creating forms that trigger long-running asynchronous tasks, always use a `<button type="submit">` with an internal state (like `isProcessing`) to conditionally render an inline loading indicator and disable the button, providing immediate and clear feedback to the user.

## 2024-03-06 - Add ARIA label to 'X' icon buttons
**Learning:** Text closures like 'X' are ambiguous for screen readers and must be equipped with descriptive `aria-label` attributes to support proper screen reader functionality.
**Action:** Always add an `aria-label` to visually-driven interactive elements or ambiguous text closures.

## 2024-05-20 - Add password visibility toggle to Reset Password
**Learning:** When introducing new interactive elements with custom classes (like `.password-toggle-btn`) inside existing components, you must ensure the corresponding CSS is also added or exists, otherwise the browser will render it with default styles that clash with the dark theme.
**Action:** Always check the paired `.css` file when adding new class names in JSX files to ensure proper styling and alignment are present.
