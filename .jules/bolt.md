## 2025-01-24 - User Controller Optimization
**Learning:** `isAuthenticatedUser` middleware already fetches and attaches the full user document to `req.user`. Subsequent controllers like `getUserDetails` often re-fetch the user from the DB using `req.user.id`, which is a redundant operation.
**Action:** In controllers following authentication middleware, check if `req.user` already contains the necessary data before making another DB call.

## 2025-02-21 - Delete Review Optimization
**Learning:** Fetching an entire parent document just to delete one item from an array (e.g., reviews in a product) is a massive performance bottleneck and a race condition (overwriting entire array).
**Action:** Use `findOne` with projection (e.g., `reviews: { $elemMatch: { _id: id } }`) to fetch only necessary data for validation, and use `$pull` in `findByIdAndUpdate` for atomic removal.

## 2025-02-23 - Frontend Re-render Computations
**Learning:** Derived state calculated from expensive array operations like `reduce` (e.g., calculating cart totals) runs synchronously on every render. If these components re-render often (e.g., due to loading states or form inputs), this becomes a bottleneck.
**Action:** Always wrap `Array.prototype.reduce`, `map`, or `filter` operations that derive data from props/state in a `useMemo` hook with strict dependencies.
## 2025-02-28 - Defer Stripe API Initialization
**Learning:** Initializing third-party heavy dependencies like Stripe (`@stripe/react-stripe-js`) and eagerly fetching their API configuration in the root `App` component unnecessarily inflates initial load times and network bandwidth for users who might not reach the checkout flow.
**Action:** Move API fetching and provider initialization logic into lazy-loaded route wrappers (e.g., `PaymentWrapper.jsx`) to code-split the logic. Store the initialized `loadStripe(apiKey)` instance in a React state hook to prevent continuous re-initialization.
